Sales Data Data Warehouse Project
The Sales Data Data Warehouse project is a data integration and analysis solution built using the AdventureWorksDW sample database provided by Microsoft. This project demonstrates the construction of a data warehouse to organize and process sales-related data for effective analysis and decision-making.

The main goal of this project is to transform raw sales and business data into a structured and optimized format for use in reporting and analytics. By leveraging SQL Server and related data tools, it enables streamlined data querying, trend analysis, and performance measurement for business intelligence applications.

Key Features:
Data Warehousing: Design and deployment of a star schema-based data warehouse for sales data.
ETL Processes: Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) pipelines to import raw data into the warehouse from various sources.
Analytics-Ready Data: Structuring data to support efficient querying for reporting and visualization.
Scalable Design: Capable of handling large volumes of data while maintaining performance.
This project is ideal for demonstrating core data warehousing concepts, SQL expertise, and the use of data visualization tools like Power BI or Tableau when connected to a well-structured database.
